# Phone-Usage-Statistics-Dashboard

Another assignment is complete on an internship, which is related to Phone Usage Statistics Dashboard. It presents a detailed analysis of mobile usage trends, including user demographics, app installations, data consumption, and recharge spending across different years.
What I discovered is that:

  1) Consistent mobile engagement:
        Data usage, gaming time, and app installations remain stable over years.
        2023 saw the highest app installations and data usage.

  2) E-commerce spending is steady:
        31M PKR in 2023, slightly higher than 2022 and 2024.
        Online shopping habits remain strong.

  3) Brand preferences are evolving:
        Oppo, Samsung, and Xiaomi are dominant in screen time & recharge costs.
        Google Pixel and Apple users have lower screen time, indicating productivity-focused use.

  4) Market shift in phone brands:
        A slight dip in 2023 indicates reduced diversity in phone brands.
        Brands with high recharge spending (Xiaomi, Realme) are gaining traction.

  5) Optimization opportunities
      Monitor app usage trends to identify emerging consumer behavior.
      Track data usage shifts to optimize network services for peak usage periods.
